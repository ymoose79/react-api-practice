# React API practice

The purpose of this app was just to familiarize myself with react, working with props, connecting with an api on the most basic level.  This project was taken from a tutorial on youtube.  


### `the API`
The API is connected with a URL, there is no key for additional security.  I wasn't concerned with creating a .env file, I'm currently only concerned with internalizing creating basic components in React.

### `the css`
I did basic styling, nothing crazy.  It is not responsive and breaks down.  I have projects that are responsive, I can use media queries to make the project responsive as I have done in other projects.  Right now, I am only trying to get my react game up.
